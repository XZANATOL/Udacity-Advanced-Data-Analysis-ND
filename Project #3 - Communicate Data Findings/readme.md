## Dataset

> This dataset contains information regarding 14,595,137 flights from the United Statess, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 2006 to 2007.

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the data, we found that the highest cause of delays came from the carrier or weather. Southwest Airlines Carrier had the worst performance with the largest number of cancellations. Atlantic Southeast Airlines "EV", Mesa Airlines "YV", Comair "OH" had the highest Carrier Delays. US performance improved to decrease the delay duration caused by NAS but facing some hard challenges to decrease that's of late aircraft & carrier delays.

All of this and more has been shown in the presentation with the help of visualisations of different dimensions.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The exploration aim was to both explore the cancellation and delays causes and analyse the US performace to reduce them. So i focused on exploring these features and highlighting their results in the presentation.
