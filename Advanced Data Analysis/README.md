# Udacity-Advanced-Data-Analysis-ND
Here are my projects used in Udacity NanoDegree program of Advanced Data Analysis track.

## First Project
I used the TMDB_movie dataset as my first project for data analysis.

## Second Project
I applied different aspects of Descriptive and Inferential Probabilities in aiddition to some machine learning models to conduct an AB test on a company dataset and find out whether a company should implement a new page design or keep the old one.

## Third Project
I used the Flights dataset to conduct something like a 2D-analysis and explored the causes of flights delays and cancels along with checking the US performance to reduce them.
