For example adding the duration of time a user spent on the page gives us an overview about whether he is interested in exploring the new page or the old page. Another example is the clicks per unique visits which also give a more detailed information about whether the design of the page is more user-freindly and allows him to access other parts of the site.

    "### 2) A/B Test Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we detailed on exploring the data and applied the central limit theorem and obtain a normal distribution that helped us decide which of the null/alternative hypothesis was correct with 5% error rate of type 1. We ended up failing to reject the null hypothesis which was:<br/>\n",
    "> \"the converted mean for the old page is bigger than that's of the new page (**$p_{old}$** > **$p_{new}$**)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We even confirmed this by running the z-test in the statsmodels library which computed the z-score and p-value, and the p-value obtained was very close to the p-value computed before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downsides:**\n",
    "> 1) The dataset shows the data was collected on a period of 21 days which is a very short period to run an A/B test.<br/>\n",
    "> 2) Due to Change aversion effect, a group of users may give an unfair advantage to the older page and same to the newer page due to Novelty effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Regression Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used some supervised machine learning algorithms (Regression) to perform some more deep analysis. Using Logistic regression, we obtained a small p-value to made us fail to reject our null hypothesis which was:<br/>\n",
    "> Both pages have same conversion rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we checked wether there was a relationship between individuals being from specific country (\"US\", \"CA\", \"UK\") and the page conversion rate and that was done using Linear regression. The obtained results was that there was a very weak relationship that almost can be neglected between both factors. (countries does not have an impact on conversion rate)"
